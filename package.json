The inspiration comes\r from a map of \"100 Places to go Before I DIe\" in which you can\r scratch off a gray layer of a certain place, revealing a cool\r little design underneath. This is meant to be a virtual way\r to do that but for calisthenics skills. I hope to eventually\r expand it from calisthenics to all strength feats.",
